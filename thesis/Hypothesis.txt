Hypothesis 1 (H1) Faithfully created objects are neither algorithmically sim-
ple, nor random. They share a similar style that can be measured as a compres-
sion ratio estimated with Kolmogorov complexity. Large deviations from this
style indicate potential manipulation.

Hypothesis 2 (H2) Combination of different sources of information in mul-
tiple, independent methods is preferable to the combination of different sources
in a single, dependent method.

Hypothesis 3 (H3) Trustworthiness is a direct result of and proportional to the computational resources spent (WTC) on detecting deceit in the network. 

Hypothesis 4 (H4) Including trust into HITS' ranking mechanism causes the creation and persistence of trustworthy objects in the network.
